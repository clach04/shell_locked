# shell_locked

Simple shell script for gpio control suitable for control from Android lock control app [Trigger](https://github.com/mwarning/trigger).

Assumes two pins:
* lock/close
* unlock/open

with momentary on each pin to actuate. Similar to https://github.com/h42i/d00r-key-server.

Recommended for use with [Trigger](https://github.com/mwarning/trigger) in ssh mode.
